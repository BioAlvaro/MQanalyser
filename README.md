<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MQanalyser is to provide the user an interface to
interactively analyse their Proteomics LC-MS/MS output.

## Installation

You can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("svalvaro/MQanalyser")
```

## Usage

You can access to the web application through:
<https://proteomics.fgu.cas.cz/ProteoAnalyser/>

## Example

To run it locally:

``` r
library(MQanalyser)

appDir <- system.file("shiny_app", package = "MQanalyser")
shiny::runApp(appDir)
```

This is how it should look like when you have uploaded your
proteinGroups.txt and the experiment design. Just press Start Analysisâ€¦
and Enjoy!
